Code materials for Pawsey Supercomputing User Training.

*Note*: Slurm scripts in this repo DO NOT contain any `#SBATCH --account=your-slurm-project` directive, so that they are portable across users.  Instead, these scripts should be submitted using the command line syntax `sbatch --account=your-slurm-project scriptname.sh`.
